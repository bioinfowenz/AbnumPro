#### This is ****AbnumPro**** , Before You Begin:
***Important note***:Since antibody numbering requires relatively low computational resources and benefits from real-time visualization, most users typically access online antibody numbering platforms on Windows systems. Additionally, the [Cao Lab](http://cao.labshare.cn/AbRSA/) has developed an antibody numbering software for Linux, enabling Linux and Mac users to perform both small- and large-scale numbering tasks, even though it may also function as an online service.Therefore, AbnumPro is currently developed exclusively for ***Windows*** users. Users can download the latest version of AbnumPro for offline use.<br>

***current version: 1.1.0***
