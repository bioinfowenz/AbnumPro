#### This is ****AbnumPro**** , Before You Begin:
***Important note***:Since antibody numbering requires relatively low computational resources and benefits from real-time visualization, most users typically access online antibody numbering platforms on Windows systems. Additionally, the [Cao Lab](http://cao.labshare.cn/AbRSA/) has developed an antibody numbering software for Linux, enabling Linux and Mac users to perform both small- and large-scale numbering tasks, even though it may also function as an online service. Therefore, AbnumPro is currently developed exclusively for ***Windows*** users. Users can download the latest version of AbnumPro for offline use.<br>

***current version: 1.1.0*** <br> 

If ***Chinese*** is your native language, congratulations~~~🎉🎉🎉 You can use AbnumPro seamlessly! If not, no worries—you can switch the language to English.👻

This document contains ***no code or scripts***, so feel free to use it with confidence!
